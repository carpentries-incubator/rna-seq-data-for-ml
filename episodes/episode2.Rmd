## ArrayExpress File Formats

Array Express data sets comprise of four important file types that contain all of the information about an experiment:

<br>

File Type | What It Is
--- | ---------
**Sample and Data Relationship Format (SDRF)** |  Tab-delimited file containing information about the samples, such as phenotypical information, and factors that may be of interest in a classification task. This file may also contain information about the relationships between the samples, and details of the file names of the raw data fastq for each sample.
**Investigation Description Format (IDF)** | Tab-delimited file containing top level information about the experiment including title, description, submitter contact details and protocols.
**Raw data files** | Sequence data and quality scores, typically stored in FASTQ format. There is however inconsistency - in some data sets, the term raw data refers to processed data in the form of raw counts data, meaning RNA-Seq counts that have not undergone further processing.
**Processed data files** | Processed data which includes raw counts or further processed abundance measures such as TPM and FPKM. The data may be provided as a separate file for each sample, or as a matrix of all samples

Detailed information about BioStudies file formats is available in the [MAGE-TAB Specification document](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/misc/MAGE-TABv1.1_2011_07_28.pdf).

## Searching for a Dataset on ArrayExpress

We will use ArrayExpress to select an RNA-Seq dataset with a case control design, suitable for constructing a machine learning classification model. Machine learning based analyses generally perform better the larger the sample size, and may perform very poorly and give misleading results with insufficient samples. Given that, we'll look for a datasets with a relatively large number of samples.

Let's begin on the [ArrayExpress home page](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/arrayexpress/studies). 

<br>

![ArrayExpress Home Page](fig/biostudies_home_page.jpg){alt='Screen Shot of Array Express Collection Tab'}

<br>

We'll apply the following filters to refine the results set, leaving all other filters as the default with no selection:

<br>

Filter                   | Selection
------------------------ | ---------------------
Study type               | rna-seq of coding rna
Organism                 | homo sapiens
Technology               | sequencing assay
Assay by Molecule        | rna assay
Processed Data Available | yes (check box)

<br>

Now use the sort in the top right of the screen to sort the results by "Samples", in descending order. The results should look similar to this:

## Illustrative Dataset: IBD Dataset

In the search results displayed above, the top-ranked dataset is E-MTAB-11349: *Whole blood expression profiling of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases in the IBD-Character cohort*. We'll call it the [IBD dataset](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/arrayexpress/studies/E-MTAB-11349).

The IBD dataset comprises human samples of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases and controls. The 'Protocols' section explains the main steps in the generation of the data, from RNA extraction and sample preparation, to sequencing and processing of the raw RNA-Seq data. The nucleic acid sequencing protocol gives details of the sequencing platform used to generate the raw fastq data, and the version of the human genome used in the alignment step to generate the count data. The normalization data transformation protocol gives the tools used to normalise raw counts data for sequence depth and sample composition, in this case normalisation is conducted using the R package [DESeq2](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html). DESEq2 contains a range of functions for the transformation and analysis of RNA-Seq data. Let's look at some of the basic information on this dataset:

<br>

Data Field              | Values
----------------------- | ---------------------
Sample count            | 590
Experimental Design     | case control design
Experimental factors    | Normal, Ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease

<br>

The dataset contains two alternative sets of processed data, a matrix of raw counts, and a matrix of processed counts that have been normalised using DESeq2, and filtered to only include transcripts with a mean raw expression read count > 10.

## Downloading and Reading into R

Let's download the SDRF file and the raw counts matrix - these are the two files that contain the information we will need to build a machine-learning classification model. In the data files box to the right-hand side, check the following two files `E-MTAB-11349.sdrf.txt` and `ArrayExpress-raw.csv`, and save them in a folder called `data` in the working directory for your R project. For consistency, rename `ArrayExpress-raw.csv` as `E-MTAB-11349.counts.matrix.csv`.

For convenience, a copy of the files is also stored on zenodo. You can run the following code that uses the function `download.file()` to download the files and save them directly into your `data` directory. (You need to have created the `data` directory beforehand). 

To get or set a working directory in R `getwd` function can be used to return an absolute file path representing the current working directory of the R process; if not correct `setwd` can be used to set the working directory to location.

```r

download.file(url = "https://zenodo.org/record/8125141/files/E-MTAB-11349.sdrf.txt",
              destfile = "data/E-MTAB-11349.sdrf.txt")
              
download.file(url = "https://zenodo.org/record/8125141/files/E-MTAB-11349.counts.matrix.csv",
              destfile = "data/E-MTAB-11349.counts.matrix.csv")
```
<br>

### Raw counts matrix

In R studio, open your project workbook and read the raw counts data. Then check the dimensions of the matrix to confirm we have the expected number of samples and transcript IDs.

```{r}

raw.counts.ibd <- read.table(file="data/E-MTAB-11349.counts.matrix.csv",
                             sep=",",
                             header=T,
                             fill=T,
                             check.names=F)

writeLines(sprintf("%i %s", c(dim(raw.counts.ibd)[1], dim(raw.counts.ibd)[2]), c("rows corresponding to transcript IDs", "columns corresponding to samples")))

```


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

## Challenge 1:

View a small subset of the data, (e.g. first ten rows and 8 columns) to see how the samples are labelled and how the sample and transcript IDs are formatted.

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

```{r}

raw.counts.ibd[1:10,1:8]

```
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


### SDRF File

Now let's read the sdrf file (a plain text file) into R and check the dimensions of the file.

```{r}

# read in the sdrf file

samp.info.ibd <- read.table(file="data/E-MTAB-11349.sdrf.txt", sep="\t", header=T, fill=T, check.names=F)

sprintf("There are %i rows, corresponding to the samples", dim(samp.info.ibd)[1])
sprintf("There are %i columns, corresponding to the available variables for each sample", dim(samp.info.ibd)[2])

```

If we view the column names, we can see that the file does indeed contain a set of variables describing both phenotypical and experimental protocol information relating to each sample.

```{r}

colnames(samp.info.ibd)

```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints
